# IoT Step Counter & Fall Detection System with Mobile App Integration

*I developed an IoT-based project that integrates step counting and fall detection using the ESP32, MPU6050 sensor, and an alcoholometer. The system captures real-time motion and environmental data, monitors step counts, and detects potential falls based on acceleration changes. Key features include:*



- Step Counting & Fall Detection: Tracks user steps and detects sudden acceleration indicative of a fall, sending alerts to the Blynk app.
- Mobile App Integration: A React Native mobile app was developed to display step count data and fall alerts in real-time from Firebase.
- Hardware Components: The project utilizes an ESP32 for connectivity, MPU6050 for motion detection, 1602 LCD display with an I2C module for data visualization, and an alcoholometer for environmental monitoring.
- Wi-Fi & Cloud Integration: The system is connected to Wi-Fi, stores data in Firebase Realtime Database, and sends notifications via Blynk for enhanced safety monitoring.




*This project showcases my expertise in IoT development, cloud services, mobile app development, and integration of various hardware components.*
